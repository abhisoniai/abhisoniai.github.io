        <p>Welcome! I'm Abhishek Soni, With over a year of intensive hands-on experience, I specialize in finding problems and then designing AI-powered automation solutions that specifically target them and revolutionize business workflows. My expertise spans crafting intelligent AI agents, custom web scrapers, and sophisticated assistants using cutting-edge technologies.</p>

        <p>I first stepped into AI in 2023, driven by curiosity to see how intelligent systems could solve real business problems. What started as experiments with automating small tasks quickly grew into building full-scale solutions AI agents, custom scrapers, and automation systems that eliminated hours of manual work.</p>

        <p>That journey led me to launch my company, where I now design AI-powered automations that streamline workflows, reduce costs, and unlock growth for businesses. My focus is simple: find inefficiencies, engineer intelligent solutions, and give teams back the time to focus on what drives revenue and impact.</p>
